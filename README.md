# Gargantua

Our attempt at recreating the black hole from Interstellar using separate CUDA and OpenGL approaches for the Heterogeneous Parallelism course

## CUDA-based

This program renders images and animations of a Schwarzschild black hole, inspired by the visuals from the movie "Interstellar". It uses ray tracing techniques accelerated via CUDA, simulating gravitational lensing and a customizable accretion disk.
